### Substraucture of a Tree

> Assume there is a tree C

![tree terminology](https://github.com/psui3905/COMP2123/blob/master/week3/tree_t3.png)

- Subtree: tree made up of some node and its descendants, but the subtree is a part of C

-  Edge: pair of nodes (u, v) such that one is the parent of the other

- Path: sequence of nodes such that 2 consecutive nodes in the sequence have an edge (e.g., <E, B, F, J>).
